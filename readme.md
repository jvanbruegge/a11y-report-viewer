# Testing area

## Generate the parsed report and run the server

`sh ./run.sh`
-> go to `localhost:3000`

## Upload

upload the `report.json` file that was generated using the file input and click submit

## Magic

View your report :)!

## Notes

its not perfect but it works and can be tidied. I have a designer helping me mock up a proper flow for this but yeah, so far so good.

Let me know your thoughts. Cheers.
